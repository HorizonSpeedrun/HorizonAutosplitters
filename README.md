# Horizon Autosplitter files

This repository hosts the automatically suggested autosplitter files for LiveSplit.

For most categories, use the autosplitter that is suggested in the `Splits Editor` after having selected the game.

Autosplitting will soon be added to the games that currently only have load-removal.

If necessary (e.g. CE Runs), the Autosplitter can manually be added to LiveSplit by adding a `Scriptable Auto Splitter` component in LiveSplit and downloading the corresponding script in the subfolder for the game:
* [Horizon Zero Dawn Autosplitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HorizonSpeedrun/HorizonAutosplitters/refs/heads/main/HZD/hzd-autosplitter.asl)
* [Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Load Remover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HorizonSpeedrun/HorizonAutosplitters/refs/heads/main/HZD/hzdr-autosplitter.asl)
* [Horizon Forbidden West Load Remover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HorizonSpeedrun/HorizonAutosplitters/refs/heads/main/HFW/hfw-autosplitter.asl)
* [Lego Horizon Adventures Autosplitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HorizonSpeedrun/HorizonAutosplitters/refs/heads/main/LHA/lha-autosplitter.asl)
